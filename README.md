# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer churn through data analysis techniques, using Python and various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify key factors leading to customer churn and predict future churn rates to help businesses retain their customers.

## Contents

- `Customer_Churn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, including:
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization of results

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was imported and cleaned, handling missing values and incorrect data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.
3. **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated for accuracy and other metrics (e.g., precision, recall) to ensure effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
